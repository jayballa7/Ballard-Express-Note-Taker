## General info
My goal with this project is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates an html page using node.js.

## Technologies
* Visual Studio Code
* Github
* Git Bash
* Node.js

## Features
List of features ready:
* Created employee classes that pass all tests.
* app.js links to the employee variables, path, and fs.
* When application is run, user is prompted to enter their info and number of members on the team. Then members of team will be prompted for their info.
* htmlRender.js takes this information and populates the html templates when app is run.
* The output is a new html page that is constructed by joining the other completed templates.

## Status
* Complete

## Inspiration
Thanks to my tutor and the TA for helping me with this assignment.
